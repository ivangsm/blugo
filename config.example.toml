# Blugo Configuration File - Example
# Copy this file to ~/.config/blugo/config.toml and customize as needed

# GENERAL SETTINGS
language = "en"      # Default language (en, es)
show_emojis = true   # Whether to show emojis in UI

# THEME SETTINGS
# Choose how blugo displays colors:
#
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Use your terminal's color scheme
theme_mode = "ansi"
# This option uses standard ANSI colors (0-15) which automatically
# match your terminal theme (Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Dracula, Nord, etc.)
# Works with any terminal emulator.
#
# Option 2: Use hardcoded colors (original blugo colors)
# theme_mode = "truecolor"
# This uses the original blugo color scheme (256-color palette).
# Looks the same across all terminals.

# PERFORMANCE & TIMING

# DISPLAY & UI

# BLUETOOTH BEHAVIOR
auto_trust_on_pair = true   # Automatically trust devices after pairing
auto_start_scanning = true  # Start scanning on app launch
remember_language = true    # Save language changes to config

# BATTERY THRESHOLDS (percentage 0-100)
battery_high_threshold = 60 # Level above which battery is "high" (green)
battery_low_threshold = 30  # Level below which battery is "low" (red)

# FILTERING & DISPLAY
